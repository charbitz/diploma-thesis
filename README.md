# Mass detection in digital breast tomosynthesis

This is the code repository of my diploma thesis. The was not the original repository. In this specific repository the final files were uploaded for demonstration purposes.

## Image Databases:

* Digital Breast Tomosynthesis dataset published by Duke University, Durham, NC. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/breast-cancer-screening-dbt/).

* The famous INBreast dataset which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramanathansp20/inbreast-dataset).

## Deep Learning Implementations:

### * Apply DBT data on YOLO network in DenseNet architecture

Here ...

### * Apply DBT and INBreast data on YOLOv5 network. 

The YOLOv5 network is implemented by [ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/). The documentation of YOLOv5 and the under development code can be found [here](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5).
